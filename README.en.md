# Hakoniwa 🌱

**A tiny world in the corner of your desktop.**

A hexagonal-block miniature garden that keeps growing, living, and cycling
through seasons — while you work. A "watch-and-relax" desktop widget.

## What is this?

A Minecraft-like sandbox floating in a transparent, always-on-top window —
but the real point is *watching*.

- 🔷 Build an island with **hexagonal blocks** (15×15 grid, resizable)
- 🧑‍🌾 Villagers have **names, personalities and jobs**, and live on their own
- 🌸 **Seasons, day/night and weather** cycle; the world grows and decays
- 🎧 **Ambient sound** — rain, birds, crickets, crackling campfires — all procedurally generated
- 🖥 The window is transparent; only the blocks' **shadow falls on your desktop**

## ✨ What happens in the world

| | |
| --- | --- |
| 🏗 **Build** | Stack and break blocks. Water flows downhill, campfires burn with smoke |
| 🌱 **Grow** | Grass spreads, flowers bloom, trees grow, villagers build huts |
| 🍂 **Decay** | Campfires burn out, flowers wither, old trees fall, huts crumble |
| 🌦 **Cycle** | Four seasons (3 days each). Fireflies on summer nights, falling leaves in autumn, frozen ponds in winter |
| 🐑 **Live** | The lumberjack fells trees and plants saplings, the farmer tends wheat, the fisher casts a line. At night everyone sleeps; every third night there's a bonfire festival |
| 🐣 **Continue** | Eggs hatch into chicks, lambs are born, travelers settle in the village |
| 💬 **Meet** | Characters greet each other when they pass by (cats are aloof) |
| 🎁 **Secrets** | A few rare visitors and events are not documented — you'll have to keep watching |
